This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you're authenticated with NPM, and have at least "read" access to the `@bayareametro` NPM organization's packages
2. Create a `.env` file from the `.env.template` file, and complete the values within the `.env` file.
3. Install dependencies (preferably with `bun`)
4. Run the development server: `bun dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
